# Madness Interactive

Welcome to the Mad Tinkers Workshop!

A collection of interconnected projects focused on building an ecosystem of AI-powered tools and agents for local development and automation.

This project defies the trend of making "AI" conform to logical and predictable norms, embracing the beauty of chaos and unpredictability.

Join us in exploring the limits of what is possible when we embrace the unknown and the chaotic nature of our own minds.

# Philosophy

*"There is no great genius without some touch of madness.  - Aristotle"*

In this Mad Era of Ai and Automation, we believe that the only way to win is to build systems that can build themselves.
For me, ADHD is a state of being aware and awake to too many possibilities in the moment. This causes us to neglect not only the project goal, but those around us, and other priorities.
Wouldn't it be great to toss every idea into the void, to be able to focus where you should, without losing all that potential?

Especially as AI agents assist us with increasing complexity, the run off can be chaotic, exessive, and yet brilliant.

I believe the only way to harness this mighty power is to equip yourself with tools that can juggle contexts and allow you to make decisions from a place of clarity.

# Who should check this out?

- You are a tinkerer, and you want to build your own tools and agents.
- You want to use MCP tooling to help you manage your own chaos.
- You are looking for tips and lessons-learned on building with Ai agent workflows.
- You are a maker, and you want to build your own tools and agents.
- You are anyone with too many ideas and not enough time.


## Core Projects

### 🌟 [Swarmonomicon](projects/common/Swarmonomicon/README.md)
*"Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see!"*

![Cover Art](docs/assets/Cover-Art.jpeg)

The central nervous system of our glorious hive mind!

### Features:

- [ ] Multi-agent consciousness with centralized hivemind registry (currently exaggerated)
- [ ] Persistent state management (wip)
- [ ] Agent-to-agent telepathy (wip)
- [ ] Pre-configured cultists for common rituals:
  - [X] Task domination
  - [ ] Git sacrifices (wip)

### 🕸️ [Omnispindle](projects/python/Omnispindle/README.md)
*"Genius is the ability to put into effect what is on your mind.!"*

A distributed task management MCP engine that falcilitates thoughts between minds:

### Features:
- [X] Orchestrate tasks across multiple agent incarnations via MCP tooling
- [ ] Command resources with an iron fist (Docker deployment)
- [ ] Scry real-time metrics from the void (MQTT dials and levers)
- [ ] Accept tribute from plugin disciples (wip)
- [ ] Enable cross-project consciousness management Dashboard (Coming Very Soon!)

#### 🗂️ [Todomill Projectorium](projects/python/Omnispindle/Todomill_projectorium/README.md)
*"Men of lofty genius sometimes accomplish the most when they work least, for their minds are occupied with their ideas and the perfection of their conceptions, to which they afterwards give form. - Leonardo da Vinci"*

A sub-repository of Omnispindle, Todomill Projectorium is a dashboard for managing todos.
Tightly integrated with the Omnispindle MCP server. It enables AI agents to interact with a MongoDB-backed todo list, allowing for review and revision of todos.

### Features:
  - Project sidebar and overview
  - Item editor for todos
  - Smart suggestions tab for AI-powered redundancy reduction
  - Control panel for project filters and refresh

- **Advanced Dashboard Controls:**
  - Filter todos by project, status, priority, and date
  - Combine filters for complex queries
  - MQTT-driven actions for creation, refresh, and filter management
  - Global context variables maintain filter state
- **Integration with Omnispindle:**
  - Omnispindle's Python MCP server enables agent-driven automation and cross-project orchestration

**Development Workflow:**
- Edit `.js` and `.html` files for logic/UI, then copy changes into Node-RED and re-export JSON flows
- Only edit `.json` files directly for node connections
- Comments in JSON files document the mapping to code files

**Future Directions:**
- Enhanced AI suggestions using historical data
- User feedback/rating for AI insights
- Team Boards
- Custom filter presets and saved views

> See [Todomill_projectorium](projects/python/Omnispindle/Todomill_projectorium/) for the full subrepo and its exported flows, code, and documentation.

### Mobile Projects

#### Cogwyrm: The Pocket Madness Interface
*"The eye of genius has always a plaintive expression, and its natural language is pathos!"*

A handheld portal of CHAOS designed for commanding your Swarmonomicon agents from the comfort of your mobile device.
This is a work in progress, and will be updated as we add more features. It aims to be a Tasker plugin enabled interface for mobile automation and Todo management.

- MQTT message summoning & communion circles
- Direct neural links to your agent hivemind
- REAL-TIME monitoring of the cosmic horror you've unleashed
- Seamless psychic bonds with Swarmonomicon's event nexus

🧪 MAD SCIENCE FEATURES:
- Cryptographic wards and binding circles for secure agent interactions
- Customizable command grimoires for frequent incantations
- Temporal logging of all interdimensional communications
- Gesture-based summoning circles for rapid agent deployment
- Emergency containment protocols (just in case)

⚡ FIELD ENHANCEMENTS:
- Haptic feedback when your agents successfully wreak havoc
- Dark mode that would make Lovecraft proud
- Configurable notification runes
- Backup sanctums for your command history
- Quick-access ritual shortcuts

## 🚀 Getting Started
*"Your first steps into BEAUTIFUL MADNESS!"*

1. Clone the repository (CAREFULLY):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/madness_interactive.git
cd madness_interactive  # ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK
```

2. Initialize the sub-realities:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive  # SUMMON THOSE TRAPPED WITHIN
```

3. Prepare your development sanctum:
```bash
# For Rust incarnations
cargo build  # FORGE THE BINARIES!!

# For Python rituals
pip install -r requirements.txt  # BIND THE DEPENDENCIES
```

4. Install the ELDRITCH GIT HOOKS for automatic status updates:
```bash
./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh [path/to/repository]  # BIND THE REPOSITORY TO OUR WILL!!
```
