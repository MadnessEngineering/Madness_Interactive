# Madness Interactive

Welcome to the Mad Tinkers Workshop!

A collection of interconnected projects focused on building an ecosystem of AI-powered tools and agents for local development and automation.
<!--
This project defies the trend of making "AI" conform to logical and predictable norms, embracing the beauty of chaos and unpredictability.

Join us in exploring the limits of what is possible when we embrace the unknown and the chaotic nature of our own minds.

# Philosophy

*"There is no great genius without some touch of madness.  - Aristotle"*

In this Mad Era of Ai and Automation, we believe that the only way to win is to build systems that can build themselves.
For me, ADHD is a state of being aware and awake to too many possibilities in the moment. This causes us to neglect not only the project goal, but those around us, and other priorities.
Wouldn't it be great to toss every idea into the void, to be able to focus where you should, without losing all that potential?

Especially as AI agents assist us with increasing complexity, the run off can be chaotic, exessive, and yet brilliant.

I believe the only way to harness this mighty power is to equip yourself with tools that can juggle contexts and allow you to make decisions from a place of clarity.

# Use Cases -->

## Saving Side Quests for Later

One of the most powerful features of our system is the ability to capture spontaneous ideas and "side quests" without derailing your main focus. Whether you're deep in a coding session and suddenly think of a brilliant feature, or you're in a meeting and realize there's a critical bug to fix later - just capture it and keep moving.

![Use Case Example: Saving a Side Quest for Later](docs/assets/images/Use-case-example-saving-a-side-quest-for-later.png)

This workflow demonstrates how AI agents can seamlessly capture, categorize, and schedule ideas while you maintain your current focus. The captured tasks are automatically organized by project, prioritized by urgency, and can be reviewed when you're ready to tackle them.

# Who should check this out?

- You are a tinkerer, and you want to build your own tools and agents.
- You want to use MCP tooling to help you manage your own chaos.
- You are looking for tips and lessons-learned on building with Ai agent workflows.
- You are a maker, and you want to build your own tools and agents.
- You are anyone with too many ideas and not enough time.

#### üóÇÔ∏è [Todomill Projectorium](projects/common/Omnispindle/Todomill_projectorium/README.md)
*"Men of lofty genius sometimes accomplish the most when they work least, for their minds are occupied with their ideas and the perfection of their conceptions, to which they afterwards give form. - Leonardo da Vinci"*

A sub-repository of Omnispindle, Todomill Projectorium is a dashboard for managing todos.
Tightly integrated with the Omnispindle MCP server. It enables AI agents to interact with a MongoDB-backed todo list, allowing for review and revision of todos.

### Features:
  - Project sidebar and overview
  - Item editor for todos
  - Smart suggestions tab for AI-powered redundancy reduction
  - Control panel for project filters and refresh

- **Advanced Dashboard Controls:**
  - Filter todos by project, status, priority, and date
  - Combine filters for complex queries
  - MQTT-driven actions for creation, refresh, and filter management
  - Global context variables maintain filter state
- **Integration with Omnispindle:**
  - Omnispindle's Python MCP server enables agent-driven automation and cross-project orchestration

**Development Workflow:**
- Edit `.js` and `.html` files for logic/UI, then copy changes into Node-RED and re-export JSON flows
- Only edit `.json` files directly for node connections
- Comments in JSON files document the mapping to code files

**Future Directions:**
- Enhanced AI suggestions using historical data
- User feedback/rating for AI insights
- Team Boards
- Custom filter presets and saved views

> See [Todomill_projectorium](projects/common/Omnispindle/Todomill_projectorium/) for the full subrepo and its exported flows, code, and documentation.

### üìä [Inventorium](projects/common/Inventorium/README.md)
